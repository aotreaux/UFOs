# UFOs

Overview

The purpose of this project was to develop a website by which UFO sighting data could be filtered and be presented in an easy to use format.

Results

To perform a search, the user can select from the fitler search box filling out the dates, city, state, country, and UFO shape. This can be performed multiple times with results being displayed in the fiter search area.

Summary

One drawback that exists for this website is that the selections within the the filter search are up to the user to input. There is not a drop down option to help the user search for what they want based on what is within the database. 

Two items that would improve the overall user experience with this website would be to (1) add a drop down selections for the various channels within the filter search and (2) clearfy what shape means with visual examples to aid in the users search.
